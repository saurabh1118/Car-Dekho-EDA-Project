# Car-Dekho-EDA-Project
The primary objective of this project was to perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the CarDekho used-car dataset to understand market trends, buyer preferences, pricing patterns, and inventory distribution.
# Final Conclusion:
The EDA reveals that CarDekho’s inventory is dominated by popular and affordable brands like Maruti, Hyundai, and Honda, with most cars falling in the ₹1–10 lakh range and featuring manual transmission. 
Buyers prefer cars with lower mileage and mid-range engine capacities, while electric vehicles remain underrepresented despite rising market demand. 
Sports and luxury cars, though fewer in number, retain strong resale value even with higher mileage.
Overall, CarDekho can improve its market reach by expanding its luxury and EV segments, adding more high-demand newer models, and using key predictors like engine capacity and max
power to enhance pricing accuracy and sales forecasting.
